Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various input features using machine learning techniques. Whether you're a wine enthusiast, a data scientist, or just someone curious about predictive modeling, this project provides valuable insights into the world of wine quality assessment.

Introduction
Predicting the quality of wines is a complex task that involves analyzing multiple factors that contribute to a wine's overall rating. This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to this problem, with the goal of building an accurate predictive model.

Features
The features used for wine quality prediction include:

Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Citric Acid
Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol

Model
In this project, we employ a machine learning model to predict wine quality. We use a Random Forest algorithm due to its robustness and ability to handle complex relationships in the data.

Thank you for visiting the Wine Quality Prediction project repository. We hope you find the information and code here valuable and insightful. Cheers to exploring the world of wine and machine learning!
